        <em>Paths</em> is a free, open source, browser-based daily word puzzle game where the central concept is the
        creation of a non-overlapping path through a grid of letters by spelling words. Each path is generated randomly
        with an algorithm that ensures the grid can be completely filled.
      </p>
      <h2>How To Play</h2>
      <p>
        Using the generated grid of letters, your goal is to create a non-overlapping "path" through the grid by
        spelling words. Words can be spelled forwards or backwards. For example, "BELL" or "LLEB". Each word must start
        or end on a letter adjacent to the last letter of the previous word (the anchoring letter). That letter will be
        marked on the grid with a dashed border. Additionally, the first letter of the first word will be marked on the
        grid with a solid border. You can see an example of this above, where the word "PATHS" was spelled in the grid.
        The first letter being "P" and the last letter being "S".
      </p>
      <p>
        Letters can be selected by either tapping on them one-by-one or by pressing and then sliding across several
        letters. When selecting one-by-one, the selection can be submitted by re-tapping the final selected letter.
        When pressing and sliding across several letters, the selection will be submitted automatically when you stop
        pressing.
      </p>
      <p>
        The area directly beneath the grid will display your current letter selection. When a word is valid for
        submission, it will turn green. Note that if the word you spell is not anchored to the existing path as
        described above, it will not be considered valid.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you play, you may find it helpful to expand the drawer beneath the grid by tapping on the arrow
        (<span class="material-symbols-outlined">expand_more</span>). This is where you can get more detailed
        information on your progress as well as where you can adjust game settings.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Paths</em> has two game modes. By default, you will be playing in <em>Challenge</em> mode. You can change
        the game mode in the game settings section of the drawer.
      </p>
      <details>
        <summary>Challenge Mode (Default)</summary>
        <p>
          In <em>Challenge</em> mode, the goal is to try to get the highest score possible. As previously mentioned, the
          grid is generated in such a way that it can be filled completely, and it is possible to solve each grid without
          swapping any letters (thus achieving the highest score possible). However, unlike <em>Pathfinder</em> mode, there
          isn't a single solution to the grid, and there are no hints. You can create whatever path through the grid you
          like, and you can swap however many letters you like.
        </p>
        <h3>Hidden Words</h3>
        <p>
          If you happen to spell one of the words used to generate the grid, or a "hidden" word, it will show up as a
          highlighted word in the list of spelled words and count towards the "Hidden Words Found" statistic. If the
          path of the word on the grid is the same as the path used during grid generation, the word will also be
          highlighted on the grid itself, denoting that the placement of that word on the grid is optimal, as it does
          not overlap with any other hidden words.
        </p>
        <h3>Swapping Letters</h3>
        <p>
          Letters can be swapped by tapping twice on a single letter, and then tapping on another letter to complete the
          swap. Swapped letters will have a purple background color. A single letter can only be swapped once. Swapped
          letters are excluded when calculating the score for a word, so try to use them sparingly, if at all.
        </p>
        <h3>Scoring</h3>
        <p>
          A word will be scored after it is validated. To be considered valid, a word must be at least three letters long
          and must be contained in the <a href="https://github.com/kflorence/word-list" target="_blank">dictionary</a>.
          Validated words are awarded points based on the letters they contain as well as a bonus multiplier for meeting
          certain word length thresholds. Any swapped letters in a word are awarded 0 points and are excluded from word
          length calculations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Letters are awarded points based on their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_frequency#Relative_frequencies_of_letters_in_the_English_language" target="_blank">frequency of usage</a>.
          The following list shows the points awarded for each letter:
        </p>
        <ul id="letter-points"></ul>
        <p>
          Words are awarded a bonus multiplier based on their length. The multiplier is calculated by taking the length of
          the word, subtracting any swapped letters, and then dividing by the grid size multiplier, rounded down to the
          nearest integer. The grid size multiplier is calculated by dividing the grid width by two, also rounded down
          to the nearest integer. The standard grid size multipliers are listed below:
        </p>
        <ul id="grid-size-multipliers"></ul>
        <p>
          Additionally, filling out the entire grid will award <strong>one point</strong> for every letter on the grid.
          For example, if you fill out an entire <code>5x5</code> grid, you will be awarded an additional
          <strong>25 points</strong>.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
          Some scoring examples are shown below. All of these scoring examples are for <code>5x5</code> grids.
        </p>
        <ul id="scoring-examples">
          <li>
            <div class="container">
              <div class="flex-left">
                <p>
                  This word is worth <strong>4 points</strong>. Note that the middle <em>E</em> has been swapped.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Letters: <code>B(3) + E(0) + E(1) = 4</code></li>
                  <li>Multiplier: <code>(3 - 1) / 2 = 1</code></li>
                  <li>Result: <code>4 * 1 = 4</code></li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Note that if this word had been a "secret" word, it would have been worth <strong>5 points</strong>,
                  since the swapped middle <em>E</em> would be included in the score.

        <summary>Pathfinder Mode</summary>
        <p>
          In <em>Pathfinder</em> mode, the goal is to figure out the hidden words that comprise the path
          through the grid, starting at the beginning of the path and working your way to the end.
          Each path is randomly generated and unique, as are the words that comprise them. Unlike <em>Challenge</em> mode,
          there is only a single set path and solution per puzzle.
        </p>
        <p>
          The grid will begin with the first letter of the first word revealed. Using that letter, you can try to guess
          the word that it belongs to. Each incorrect guess will reveal any letters that are shared between your guess
          and that hidden word. Each subsequent guess must use all of the previously revealed letters. As you guess, pay
          attention to the indicators displayed next to the words as you select them. These will tell you about the
          length of your guess in comparison to the hidden word:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>&gt;</code> - the hidden word is longer than your guess</li>
          <li><code>&lt;</code> - the hidden word is shorter than your guess</li>
          <li><code>=</code> - the hidden word is the same length as your guess</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you get stuck, you can tap the hint (<span class="material-symbols-outlined">help</span>) button, which
          will reveal the next unrevealed letter in the hidden word. If the hint button is disabled, that means you have
          already revealed all letters of the hidden word.
